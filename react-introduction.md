# React Introduction 5/20/2022

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Library - collection of code snippets

yarn - package manager, collects node modules and makes them useful

Scale/scalable - ability to manage a thing getting bigger

Developer's goals in creating React:
1. Code can be reusable
2. Handle user interactions quickly and efficiently

## Reusable
Components - classes or functions, we will focus on classes and object-oriented programming

## Efficiency
Reacting to the user view
DOM - document object model, visual representation of the code
HTML elements/tags are called nodes when talking about the DOM
React isolates a particular node and only makes changes to that one thing
VDOM - virtual DOM, listens for a diff, isolates the node, and reconciles the diff
